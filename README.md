# CS_6376_Final_Project

## Simulink
In order to run the Simulink portion, we used MATLAB R2022a Update 4 (9.12.0.2009381) for Mac (maci64). We included the Control System Toolbox, Simulink Control Design, Simulink Check, and Requirements Toolbox add-ons available with the academic license for MATLAB. 

To run the Simulink models, be sure to have the equivalent MATLAB version for your machine along with Simulink. Include the add-on listed above (these can be found in the "add-ons" section of the MATLAB window). After that, you should be able to run the Simulink models. 

## Python
The Python is written with Python 3.10.6. To run the simulator, run `python3 sim.py`. You can edit the source file to configure the number of steps, the network configuration, etc.

To test an individual component, uncomment the `test()` function call at the bottom of its corresponding file and run that file with Python (e.g., `python3 bridge.py`).
